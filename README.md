Hi there 👋 thanks for visiting!

Most of the basic info you might want has been given a place on this page – [**github.com/LL782**](https://github.com/LL782) (quite possibly you are here already). I can add a bit more detail about who I work for:

## 🏭 
- 🚗 [**Cazoo**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cazoo) – I'm an **individual contributor** on a team building and app for doing quality control on the cars before they are delivered
- 🧐 [**Codurance**](https://www.codurance.com/) – the consultancy I work for. We are **Software Craftspeople** loving **Agile**, **Extreme Programming** and **Lean**
- 🛕 [**DC5B**](https://www.dc5b.com/) – the nebulous organisation that has a spiritual connection to all my **personal projects**. It's art, egalitarianism and improving reality

## Getting started

Tip for getting up and running with me (it's a open-source metaphor)

### The basics you should know about me are ...

- Fifteen years making websites. 
- Based in London. 
- Studied Visual Communications. 
- Very comfortable with visual metaphor. 
- Values carefully designed communication.

#### Visual metaphor, design school trained and naturally creative

That also explains my love of well crafted user experience (UX) and well designed user interfaces (UI). 

I could be a frontend specialist – my CSS and HTML skills are pretty 🔥 However, my focus is on delivering value to customers so I've always worked fullstack – it's hard to deliver holistic quality otherwise. I work well in teams and my love of Agile and Extreme Programming values, principles and practices has given me a decent base upon which to build. These days I have a wealth of experience from large, medium and small scale organisations, in various industries, most often from an e-commerce perspective.

As a hobbyist I draw and paint. I build software related to arts and cartography and I engage socially and creatively in role playing adventure games 🐉 ⚔️ 🪄 etc. 

#### A developer who specialises in writing easy to maintain, human readable code, driven by well-considered tests and design decisions

"Professionalism, Pride and Pragmatism" is a great subtitle for a great book ([The Software Craftsman](https://www.codurance.com/publications/the-software-craftsman)) and one I would be happy to use as a subtitle for my career.

#### Written Communication

Async comms have massive value. I could write more on that if you're interested. I strive for mastery of this talent – communicating through writing in such a way that we can all contribute in our own way in our own time. It's not that simple of course but that's the vision.

I cut my teeth on a forum called [Dynamic Drive](http://dynamicdrive.com/) (it makes me smile that it's still there). That's where I learnt that time spent crafting the write messages is worth it.  Trying to articulate the problem that you are feeling blocked by, especially if it is a knowledge gap, is a great practice and I can't recommend it highly enough. Many times I ended up not posting my questions at all because I'm researching the right vocabulary and really explaining the intricacies of what was going on I'd solve my own problems.   

#### Work in progress

Isn't everything these days? This is an early draft of my profile README and feedback is always welcome. Anyway, I look forward to working together. One last important point: I ask a lot of questions and encourage anyone working with me to do the same, so...

**Ask me anything**

My notes:

I'm drawing from three sources of inspiration for this README:

1. A colleague's [profile README](https://github.com/gargath/gargath)
1. [GitHub's docs ](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme) on customizing your profile README
1. The [manual of me](https://www.manualof.me) concept
