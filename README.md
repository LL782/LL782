Hi there 👋 thanks for visiting!

If you're not already at https://github.com/LL782 that's where you can go to get my profile. My guess is you're here because if we're not already working together we might be in future. I love open source, please feel free to reach out with any questions, suggestions or comments.

## 🏭 Current work
🚗 [**Cazoo**](https://github.com/Cazoo-uk) – I'm an **individual contributor** on the Vehicle Quality team. We build an app for road testers, ramp checkers, final quality controllers and operations managers to ensure cars reach customers in the best condition, and on time.

🧐 [**Codurance**](https://www.codurance.com/) are the consultancy I work with. We wrote the book on **Software Craftsmanship** and specialise in **Agile**, **Extreme Programming**, **Lean**, **TDD**, **Simple Design**, **DDD**, **pairing** – all that good stuff 🧡

🛕 [**DC5B**](https://www.dc5b.com/) – the nebulous organisation that has a spiritual connection to all my **personal projects**. It's art, egalitarianism and improving reality. Yeah stuff magical in that direction. 

## Getting started

Tip for getting up and running with me (it's a open-source metaphor)

### The basics you should know about me are ...

- Fifteen years making websites. 
- Based in London. 
- Studied Visual Communications. 
- Very comfortable with visual metaphor. 
- Values carefully designed communication.

#### Visual metaphor, design school trained and naturally creative

That also explains my love of well crafted user experience (UX) and well designed user interfaces (UI). 

I could be a frontend specialist – my CSS and HTML skills are pretty 🔥 However, my focus is on delivering value to customers so I've always worked fullstack – it's hard to deliver holistic quality otherwise. I work well in teams and my love of Agile and Extreme Programming has given me a decent base upon which to build. These days I have a wealth of experience from large, medium and small scale organisations, in various industries.

As a hobbyist I draw and paint. I build software related to arts and cartography and I engage socially and creatively in role playing adventure games 🐉 ⚔️ 🪄 etc. 

#### A developer who specialises in writing easy to maintain, human readable code, driven by well-considered tests and thoughtful design

"Professionalism, Pride and Pragmatism" is a great subtitle for a great book ([The Software Craftsman](https://www.codurance.com/publications/the-software-craftsman)) and one I would be happy to use as a subtitle for my career. Since joining Codurance in 2019 I've gone deep into my understanding of agile. How to build valuable software, or how to deliver value to customers, is the question underlying all the work we do and for me it's what binds all forms of best practice software engineering together. That and a love of learning is something I share with all my colleagues.

#### Written Communication

Async comms have massive value. I could write more on that if you're interested. I strive for mastery of this talent – communicating through writing in such a way that we can all contribute in our own way in our own time. It's not that simple of course but that's the vision.

I cut my teeth on a forum called [Dynamic Drive](http://dynamicdrive.com/) (it makes me smile that it's still there). That's where I learnt that time spent crafting the write messages is worth it.  Trying to articulate the problem that you are feeling blocked by, especially if it is a knowledge gap, is a great practice and I can't recommend it highly enough. Many times I ended up not posting my questions at all because I'm researching the right vocabulary and really explaining the intricacies of what was going on I'd solve my own problems.   

#### Work in progress

Isn't everything these days? This is an early draft of my profile README and feedback is always welcome. Anyway, I look forward to working together. One last important point: I ask a lot of questions and encourage anyone working with me to do the same, so...

**Ask me anything**

I'm drawing from three sources of inspiration for this README:

1. A colleague's [profile README](https://github.com/gargath/gargath)
1. [GitHub's docs ](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme) on customizing your profile README
1. The [manual of me](https://www.manualof.me) concept
