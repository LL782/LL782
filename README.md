# Laurence "DC5B" Lord

A software engineer and artist specialising in simple step. 

### What do I do?

I develop ideas into products through creativity and software craft.

```
I come up with ideas rapidly
Work with teams and individuals
Gather feedback early and often
Test with users to improve results
Automate to save time and scale.

I create art, and 
I trade
```

### Who am I?

Hard to even understand the question and I was the one who asked it.

Maybe look in a mirror?
