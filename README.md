# Laurence "DC5B" Lord

A software engineer and artist specialising in simple step. 

### What do I do?

I develop ideas into products through creativity and software craft.

```
I come up with ideas rapidly
I work with teams and individuals
I gather feedback early and often
I test with users to improve products
I develop software solutions
I create art, and 
I trade
```

### Who am I?

Hard to even understand the question and I was the one who asked it.

Maybe look in a mirror?
