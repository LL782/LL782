# Laurence "DC5B" Lord

I'm am a creative developer specialising in baby steps and simple design. 

I work at a fantastic consultancy called [**Codurance**](https://www.codurance.com/) and in my spare time I am growing a business called [**DC5B**](https://www.dc5b.com/) that develops ideas into art products through collaboration with our customers. 

<!--
I've started a "manual of me" (at [my.manualof.me/s/e29...](https://my.manualof.me/s/e291f5b21d24dfd3bb93325223ff781a))

This document is a user manual for getting the most out of me.

### Things you should know about me

- Fifteen years making websites
- London based
- Visual Communications trained

That explains my love of well crafted user experience and well designed user interfaces. 

I could be a frontend specialist – my CSS and HTML skills are pretty 🔥 However, my focus is on delivering value to customers so I've always worked fullstack – it's hard to deliver holistic quality otherwise. I work well in teams and my love of Agile and Extreme Programming has given me a decent base upon which to build. These days I have a wealth of experience from large, medium and small scale organisations, in various industries.

As a hobbyist I draw and paint. I build software related to arts and cartography and I engage socially and creatively in role playing adventure games 🐉 ⚔️ 🪄 etc. 

#### A developer who specialises in writing easy to maintain, human readable code, driven by well-considered tests and thoughtful design

"Professionalism, Pride and Pragmatism" is a great subtitle for a great book ([The Software Craftsman](https://www.codurance.com/publications/the-software-craftsman)) and one I would be happy to use as a subtitle for my career. Since joining Codurance in 2019 I've gone deep into my understanding of agile. How to build valuable software, or how to deliver value to customers, is the question underlying all the work we do and for me it's what binds all forms of best practice software engineering together. That and a love of learning is something I share with all my colleagues.

#### Written Communication

Async comms have massive value. I could write more on that if you're interested. I strive for mastery of this talent – communicating through writing in such a way that we can all contribute in our own way in our own time. It's not that simple of course but that's the vision.

I cut my teeth on a forum called [Dynamic Drive](http://dynamicdrive.com/) (it makes me smile that it's still there). That's where I learnt that time spent crafting the write messages is worth it.  Trying to articulate the problem that you are feeling blocked by, especially if it is a knowledge gap, is a great practice and I can't recommend it highly enough. Many times I ended up not posting my questions at all because I'm researching the right vocabulary and really explaining the intricacies of what was going on I'd solve my own problems.   

#### Work in progress

Isn't everything these days? This is an early draft of my profile README and feedback is always welcome. Anyway, I look forward to working together. One last important point: I ask a lot of questions and encourage anyone working with me to do the same, so...

**Ask me anything**
