Hi there üëã thanks for visiting! I don't really know who is reading this and that makes it hard to write. We may or may not know each other ‚Äì a colleague, a friend, a boss, a recruiter, a potential employer, potentially anyone who stumbles upon any of my public contributions. You are at least a little bit technically minded to be looking at a software crafter's profile on a source-code version-management website. If you're any of these perhaps the best things I can write would help us to collaborate effectively. I'll try to present the useful information that relates to professional and personal project alike. 

Most of the basic info you might want has been given a place on this page ‚Äì assuming your are here [**github.com/LL782**](https://github.com/LL782). I can add a bit more detail to who I work for:

## üè≠ 
- üöó [**Cazoo**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cazoo) ‚Äì I'm an **individual contributor** on a team building tools for the people doing quality control on the cars
- üß° [**Codurance**](https://www.codurance.com/) ‚Äì the consultancy I work for. We are **Software Craftspeople** loving **Agile**, **Extreme Programming** and **Lean**
- üõï [**DC5B**](https://www.dc5b.com/) ‚Äì the organisation I associate my **personal projects** with

#### The basics you should know about me are ...

Fifteen years making websites. Based in London. Studied Visual Communications. Very comfortable working with visual metaphor. I put a lot of value in carefully designed communication.

That also explains my love of well crafts user experience (UX) and well designed user interfaces (UI). I could be thought of as a frontend specialist (my CSS and HTML is pretty good) but my focus is on delivering to customers, so over the years I've naturally worked fullstack. I identify as a develop who specialises in writing easy to maintain, human readable code, driven by well-considered tests and design decisions.

Professionalism, Pride and Pragmatism is a great subtitle for a great book (The Software Craftsman) and one I would be happy to use as a subtitle for my career.

#### Written Communication
Async comms have massive value. I could write more on that if you're interested. I strive for mastery of this talent ‚Äì communicating through writing in such a way that we can all contribute in our own way in our own time. It's not that simple of course but that's the vision.

I grew up on a forum called [Dynamic Drive](http://dynamicdrive.com/). It makes me smile that it's still there (although it's light-blue now and used to be green). I think that's one of the first places where I learnt to spend a long time on my messages to other devs.

**Ask me anything**
