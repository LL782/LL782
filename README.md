# Laurence "DC5B" Lord

A software engineer and artist specialising in simple steps. 

### What do I do?

I develop ideas into products through creativity and software craft.

```
I come up with ideas rapidly
Work with teams and individuals
Gather feedback early and often
Test with users to improve results
Automate to save time and scale.

I create art, and 
I trade
```

Maybe look in a mirror?
