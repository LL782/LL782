## Getting started

Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### [I've started a "manual of me"](https://my.manualof.me/s/e291f5b21d24dfd3bb93325223ff781a)

#### The basics you should know about me are ...

I am a software craftsperson, based in London with about fifteen years making websites. I studied Visual Communications, which is a key feature of my professional mindset. I am very comfortable working with visual metaphor and I put a lot of value in carefully designed communication.

That also explains my love of well crafts user experience (UX) and well designed user interfaces (UI). I could be thought of as a frontend specialist (my CSS and HTML is pretty good) but my focus is on delivering to customers, so over the years I've naturally worked fullstack. I identify as a develop who specialises in writing easy to maintain, human readable code, driven by well-considered tests and design decisions.

Professionalism, Pride and Pragmatism is a great subtitle for a great book (The Software Craftsman) and one I would be happy to use as a subtitle for my career.
